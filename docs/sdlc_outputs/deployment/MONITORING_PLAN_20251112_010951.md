- **Request volume**: Track trend
- **Success rate**: Target > 99%

### Database Metrics

## 3. Monitoring Tools

### Application Logs
```bash
# Real-time logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/iact/gunicorn.log

# Error logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/iact/error.log

# Filter for feature-related logs
sudo grep "feature-keyword" /var/log/iact/gunicorn.log
```

### Database Monitoring
```bash
# Active connections
mysql -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD -e "SHOW PROCESSLIST;"

# Slow queries
mysql -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD -e "SELECT * FROM mysql.slow_log ORDER BY start_time DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Session table size
mysql -h $DB_HOST -u $DB_USER -p$DB_PASSWORD -e "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM django_session;" iact_production
```

### Health Checks
```bash
# Application health
curl -f http://localhost/api/health

# Feature health
curl -f http://localhost/api/feature-health

# Database health
curl -f http://localhost/api/db-check
```

---

## 4. Alerting Thresholds

### Critical Alerts (Immediate Response)
- Health check fails
- Error rate > 5%
- Response time > 5s
- Database connections exhausted

### Warning Alerts (Monitor Closely)
- Error rate > 2%
- Response time > 3s
- Memory usage > 80%
- Session table > 100k records

---

## 5. Monitoring Schedule

### First 2 Hours (Intensive)
- Check metrics every 15 minutes
- Review logs continuously
- Be ready to rollback

### First 24 Hours (Regular)
- Check metrics every hour
- Review logs every 2 hours
- Monitor alerts

### First Week (Follow-up)
- Daily metrics review
- Weekly summary report

---

## 6. Incident Response

### If Issue Detected
1. Assess severity
2. Notify team
3. Gather data (logs, metrics)
4. Decide: Fix forward or rollback
5. Execute decision
6. Verify resolution
7. Document incident

### Escalation Path
1. Deploy Lead
2. Backend Lead
3. DevOps Lead
4. CTO

---

## 7. Success Indicators

- No critical alerts in first 24h
- Error rate < 1%
- Response times stable
- User adoption positive
- No rollback required
